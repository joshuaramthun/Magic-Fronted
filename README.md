## Iteration 3
I Implemented all functionality for creating a deck along with the animation of the deck that includes all of the cards in the deck in a shuffled order. I improved the search bar functionality for the deck along with buttons to increase/decrease quantity of the cards in the deck. After completion of all functionality, I removed all unused code.

## Iteration 2
Implemented all login/logout functionality. I created pages for decks list, creation of new deck, as well as for a single deck. I had encountered a bug with navigating to a new deck after creation. Which I was able to fix after seeking assitance from professor and TAs. I fixed card state within Cardslist and added get single card, along with card images. I also implemented the ability to purchase cards link.

Below are four screenshots of changes since last iteration.

by using inventory and card services. Below are the screenshots of Deployed frontend and backend.
